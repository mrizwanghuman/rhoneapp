<div class="description container"><h3>The Rhone Ambassador Description</h3>
A person who is a good representation of our brand in their everyday life. 
The most important quality we are looking for is having a strong moral compass. Our company is based on standards like quality, integrity, honesty and we want those qualities in our ambassadors. These people will be an extension of our brand and form the pillars of the community we are trying to build. They must be people we look up to on a moral level not just look up to because of accomplishments and achievement. The Rhone ambassador is honest, has a high level of integrity, commitment to their goals, they should be a leader and inspiration in their own community. 

The Rhone Ambassador needs to have some exceptional characteristic or achievement. It could be an achievement in sport or an achievement in the workplace but the Rhone ambassador needs to be an aspirational figure that people look up to. If the person is successful in their professional life (sport, work, task) but also is a good person then others will look up to them and want to aspire to be like them and emulate their behavior. We want to give people a person to measure up to, a person to try and live up to.

Once a person is a Rhone Ambassador they will be a Rhone Ambassador on an ongoing basis. The first engagement will be a year. At the end of each year there should be a renewal option on both sides. From our perspective if we choose the right person we will want them to be anambassador every year. as we continue to build our community and extended family but from their side we should want each person to have an active interest in the brand and to live the brand. If at some point the person doesn't want to be an ambassador we can let them go. We want people who organically live and breathe the brand. Authenticity is the most important trait we want to capitalize on .

These people will be our 'generals' so to speak on the ground and will interact with the public via social media, video, newsletter and also in person. 

The Rhone ambassador will be treated as an important member of our family. We will provide them with $2500 worth of clothing per year, produce a high quality video telling their story, place them in our newsletter, and give them a forum to discuss what is important to them. As they are exceptional people we want their story to be told
